# OldStyle-TypeSpeedTest
Just a random project. I wanted to create typing speed test with some old style (I played some Rdr2 recently..)

To start this app, just start typing in the input box. First letter will start the timer

How was it?


--- There are some problem with mobile responsiveness but works fine on PC. Will try to fix it later
